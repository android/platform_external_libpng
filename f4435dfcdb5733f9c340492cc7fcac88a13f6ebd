No \u0027else\u0027.\nNot sure if this has to do with a bug, of if it\u0027s just a more accurate way to do the check.",

      "message": "Yes, I noticed. The advisory seems to claim the fix in 0.16 is sufficient.\n\nRe: three separate statements and elses. I think in this particular case they have equivalent semantics (since width would like between 0 and PNG_UINT_31_MAX).\n\nLooking at git histories, they\u0027ve flip flopped a few times between \"else if\" and \"if\" and made a few \"code style\" cleanups in the interim. (all of which makes our job harder).",
