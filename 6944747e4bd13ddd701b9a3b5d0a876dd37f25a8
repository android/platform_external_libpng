And only this folder is mentioned. (Maybe I am mistaken and all the other stuff that looks new to me actually *is* new since 1.6.25?)\n\nShould I add the rest of the new stuff? My initial thought was that it makes merges simpler if we just add it all, but after doing it a couple times I don\u0027t think it is that much simpler (and it leads to a giant CL, most of which is not really relevant). I\u0027m leaning towards only checking in the stuff that we use, but think perhaps that should be its own CL?",
