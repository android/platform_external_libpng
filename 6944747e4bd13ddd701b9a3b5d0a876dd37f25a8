      "message": "I find this one a little strange - it appears that we don\u0027t check in some files that aren\u0027t used, but we do check in others that aren\u0027t used. And only this folder is mentioned. (Maybe I am mistaken and all the other stuff that looks new to me actually *is* new since 1.6.25?)\n\nShould I add the rest of the new stuff? My initial thought was that it makes merges simpler if we just add it all, but after doing it a couple times I don\u0027t think it is that much simpler (and it leads to a giant CL, most of which is not really relevant). I\u0027m leaning towards only checking in the stuff that we use, but think perhaps that should be its own CL?",

      "message": "i\u0027d just add it all. i know historically some people liked to not add unused code, but as someone who\u0027s spent many years trying to keep parts of external up to date, i\u0027ve come to the conclusion that it makes that slightly harder without helping in any other way. these days i like to just have everything. it also makes it easier to do a quick diff against the upstream version i believe i have to see that no patches got dropped (and also -- if we have local changes -- to keep those local changes in a checked-in diff for the convenience of the next person).\n\nthe truth is, no human can really review even a change like this with 3k changed lines (unless it\u0027s done patch at a time, in meaningful chunks, as they come in, and most projects just aren\u0027t worth that trouble). an extra few k doesn\u0027t materially change that.",
